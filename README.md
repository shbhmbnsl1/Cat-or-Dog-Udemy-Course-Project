# Cat-or-Dog-Udemy-Course-Project
A model having a Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether image is of a cat or a dog

A CNN is built using python. Training set contains two folders cats and dogs which are corresponding to images of cats and dogs respectively. Similarly test set. 
Convolutional Neural networks are best for image classification problems using core Artificial Neural Networks.
